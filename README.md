A demonstration of how basic techniques (ordinary linear regression, polynomial fit, Fourier transform) can be applied to analyse and forecast temperature data. The goal is to build a linear model that predict the temperature increase as a function of population influx to a region. In the Jupyter notebook, we showcase the situation in London.

The weather data and population data are collected from [meteostats](https://dev.meteostat.net/python/) and [macrotrend](https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/cities/22860/london/population), respectively.
